# Excel-List-Counter-Macro
A VBA macro to count the number of matching instances in a list, then reduce the list to only unique values with original counts next to them. So for example a column list of "apple, apple, orange" will return two columns showing each unique value with it's count: "Apple | 2, Orange | 1"
